# Restaurant reviews

This project has been created as part of the Udacity FEND nanodegree. The aim of the project was to convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. From a static design that lacks accessibility, I have converted it to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I've also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.
